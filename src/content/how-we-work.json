            "description": "We don’t start with assumptions. We embed ourselves in your technical and business context to perform a deep-dive audit of your existing infrastructure, codebase, and team workflows. This allows us to identify hidden bottlenecks and map out a realistic path to modernization."

            "description": "Success is built on a solid foundation. We design a high-level architecture that prioritizes scalability, security, and maintainability. Every decision is documented through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), ensuring clarity on why specifically chosen technologies were selected over alternatives."
